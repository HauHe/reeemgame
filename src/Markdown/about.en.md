## About the Power Decisions Game

The Power Decisions Game is a learning simulation of how the future could look depending on how the player decides to act. The goal is to maximize the score in 2050, considering the social, environmental and economic dimensions decade by decade.

The game aims to let the player interactively discover how (policy) decisions might affect the development of the European electricity sector in the transition to a low carbon system. At three points in time (2020, 2030, 2040) decisions need to be made concerning the emission reduction pathway, the use of carbon capture and storage technologies, the trans-border electricity transmission between European countries, and import of biomass for power generation.

The Power Decisions Game features data about e.g. electricity demands and emission limits in Europe over time and the player can review the data in order to make good decisions.

All partners within the REEEM project have contributed to the learning simulation by providing feedback throughout the development process.

The Power Decisions Game was part of the [Stakeholder Engagement and Dissemination work package](http://www.reeem.org/index.php/work-packages/) in the REEEM project. The game is based on [OSeMBE](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2021.121973), which is the open source energy model base for the European Union.
